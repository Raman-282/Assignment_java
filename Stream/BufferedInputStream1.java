/*Is a FilterInputStream, which provides the ability of buffering the input, to another input stream
 By default, the streams are not buffered. When a BufferedInputStream is created, an internal buffer array is created
 When a read is done, BufferedInputStream reads multiple bytes in to the buffer using the original input stream
 Improves performance significantly, as number of reads on the original input stream are reduced*/
